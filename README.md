--Potato Leaf Disease Classification using Deep Learning

I recently built a Convolutional Neural Network model to classify potato leaf diseases using image data.

Problem Statement
Early detection of plant diseases helps reduce crop loss and improve agricultural productivity.

Approach

Built a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras

Image size: 256 × 256

Train, validation, test split: 80, 10, 10

Optimizer: Adam

Loss: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy

Classes Predicted

Early Blight

Late Blight

Healthy

Result
Achieved XX% accuracy on the test dataset.
(Replace with your actual accuracy)

Key Learnings

Importance of proper dataset splitting

Handling image preprocessing

Avoiding overfitting using validation data

Building end to end deep learning pipeline
